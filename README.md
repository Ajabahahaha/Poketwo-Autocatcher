### Requirements

#### <b>Running the bot</b>
To start up the bot for the first time, STAR THIS REPO then clone the repo by this link to your local machine or replit (wherever you wish) [click here](https://github.com/AkshatOP/Poketwo-Autocatcher.git) 
Once you have done that hit `npm install discord.js-self express ocr-space-api-wrapper` in console.

After That enter in the following fields in **Config.json**:

##### <b>TOKEN</b>:
Paste in your discord account's user token. You can find instructions on this [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W9tAEsK7RM)

##### <b>spamChannelID</b>:
This will allow the bot to use your preferred channel to spam as well as catch Pokétwo spawns. Make sure you paste this carefully, as If you set it to the wrong channel it will spam and catch there.

##### <b>logChannelID</b>:
This will allow the bot to use your preferred channel to log the pokemons caught in a desired channel of yours.

##### <b>errorChannelID</b>:
This will allow the bot to use your preferred channel to log the errors of code in a desired channel of yours.

##### <b>ocrSpaceApiKey</b>:
This is the MOST IMPORTANT part. You have to create an ocrSpace account and put it's API key. Click [here](https://ocr.space/ocrapi/freekey) to get free API-KEY

After you've entered that in, the autocatcher should start successfully. (if not, check if you have entered in the right fields)

> Remember to cd into your autocatcher folder as well. If you need any help with something, feel free to open a Github Issue.

## **DISCLAIMER**

Please note that self botting is against Discord's Terms of Service and being discovered using a self bot may result in your account being banned. To avoid this, keep knowledge of your self bot to a minimum and use a throwaway account. I am not responsible for any accounts lost due to the self bot. I also recommend checking the self bot channel's messages occasionally to see if Pokétwo has sent a captcha. **If it has, it would be a good idea to solve it.**
