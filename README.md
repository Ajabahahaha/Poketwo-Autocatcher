#### <b>Running the bot</b>
To start up the bot for the first time, STAR THIS REPO then clone the repo by this link to your local machine or replit (wherever you wish) [click here](https://github.com/AkshatOP/Poketwo-Autocatcher.git) 
Once you have done that hit `npm install discord.js-self express ocr-space-api-wrapper` in console.

## **Specific Channel Support**
If you want to run the bot so that it catches only in specific channels then Head over to LINE 17 of #index.js and fill the array with channel IDs of those channel you want to catch in.
*Leave it like [ ] if you don't want this feature* 

After That enter in the following fields in **Config.json**:

##### <b>TOKEN</b>:
Paste in your discord account's user token. You can find instructions on this [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W9tAEsK7RM)
*CAUTION*
If you are using repl.it and don't want your token to be leaked. Follow this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKlv__1OoGc) to secure your token and apply that fix in line 130 of index.js. 

##### <b>spamChannelID</b>:
This will allow the bot to use your preferred channel to spam as well as catch Pok√©two spawns. Make sure you paste this carefully, as If you set it to the wrong channel it will spam and catch there.

##### <b>logChannelID</b>:
This will allow the bot to use your preferred channel to log the pokemons caught in a desired channel of yours.

##### <b>errorChannelID</b>:
This will allow the bot to use your preferred channel to log the errors of code in a desired channel of yours.

##### <b>ocrSpaceApiKey</b>:
This is the MOST IMPORTANT part. You have to create an ocrSpace account and put it's API key. Click [here](https://ocr.space/ocrapi/freekey) to get free API-KEY

After you've entered that in, the autocatcher should start successfully. (if not, check if you have entered in the right fields)

> Remember to cd into your autocatcher folder as well. If you need any help with something, feel free to open a Github Issue.

> ALL Done you can now start your bot by typing `node index.js` in the console 

### Auto-levelling
To enable auto-levelling, just select the pokemon in that autocatcher ID and let it auto-level

# ERRORS
This bot uses Free API for predicting pokemon names so it sometimes gives in accurate results like
Instead of "@poketwo catch Magikarp"  it writes "@poketwo catch Macikarp" 

To fix this I have made a `namefix.json` where you can change the incorrect names with the correct ones

**For example**
Go to namefix.json and edit it as stated
```js
{
    "APPUN": "APPLIN",
    "MACIKARP": "MAGIKARP",
    "put wrong name here with uppercase": "put Correct name here",//edit here and keep all characters UPPERCASE
    "NIDORAN (F)": "NIDORAN" 
  }
```
like if it's saying Dragapult as Dracapult and rockruff as Rocktuff
add these line here like this 

```js
{
    "APPUN": "APPLIN",
    "MACIKARP": "MAGIKARP",
    "ROCKTUFF": "ROCKRUFF",//edit here but in upperCase characters 
    "DRACAPULT": "DRAGAPULT",//edit here but in upperCase characters 
    "NIDORAN (F)": "NIDORAN"
   
  }

```
If you want to contribute to the community Please post the json you made after a few weeks of use of this bot here or DM me that json in Discord üôÇ

## **DISCLAIMER**

Please note that self botting is against Discord's Terms of Service and being discovered using a self bot may result in your account being banned. To avoid this, keep knowledge of your self bot to a minimum and use a throwaway account. I am not responsible for any accounts lost due to the self bot. I also recommend checking the self bot channel's messages occasionally to see if Pok√©two has sent a captcha. **If it has, it would be a good idea to solve it.**
